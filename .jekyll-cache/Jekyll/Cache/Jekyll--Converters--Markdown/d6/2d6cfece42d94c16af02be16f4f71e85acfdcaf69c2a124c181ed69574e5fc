<p>NO2 in troposphere is an important air pollutant and respiratory system irritant at excess concentration levels. Many countries across the globe have been putting efforts into reducing its emission. Trend reversals in US, Western Europe and Eastern China have been detected using satellite observations. But ground measurements from EPA air quality stations seem to suggest otherwise. Therefore, it is necessary to compare NO2 time series from satellite imagery and ground measurements to see if the trend change in NO2 surface concentration is observed in the long run by EPA air quality stations.</p>

<p>Stratospheric NO2 contributes to most of the column where there is no NO2 emission on the ground. Itâ€™s variable at different timescales. NO2 decays in the night, and stratospheric NO2 can also change over several days/weeks due to change in chemistry and/or transport. Seasonal trend where stratospheric NO2 is the highest during summers is also observed. Yet, solar cycleâ€™s effect on stratospheric NO2 has not been observed by satellites. Therefore studying solar cycles from existing satellite records, as well as from previous attempts to construct stratospheric NO2 vertical columns could help us understand solar cycleâ€™s effect on stratospheric chemistry.</p>

<p>Network of air quality stations using chemiluminescence has been established in the US and some other countries. Chemiluminescence instruments use heated MoOx surface to reduce NO2 to NO and the latter is measured. However, they have the problem of overestimating NO2 concentration because they convert other nitrogen compounds (e.g. HONO, PAN) to NO too. Thus it is worth looking for an approach to reduce the bias, making historical and future data collected by these instruments more usable.</p>
