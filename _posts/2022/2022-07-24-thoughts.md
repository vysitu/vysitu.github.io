# Next up
Move all the codes that may be useful to others to my GitHub and create them as repos.

## Possible repositories to create
 - File handling demos
 - Data visualization demos
 - Meteorological / remote sensing data aquisition and processing functions
 - Bug-fixing guides

## Other notes
I should also try creating snippets for quick reference. Many processing routines are just several functions wrapped together.
